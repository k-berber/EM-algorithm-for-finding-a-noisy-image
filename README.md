# EM-algorithm-for-finding-a-noisy-image
A sample of X highly noisy black-and-white images of size H × W pixels is given. Each of these images contains the same stationary background and the face of the criminal in unknown coordinates, with the face falling into any image as a whole. We will assume that the face image has a rectangular shape of h × w pixels. The h, w values are w = 66, h = 100.
